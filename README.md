# StockMarketCheck

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.5 and it was built to check the history of a stock market share.

Run the application, search for a stock market share and then check the chart and table for the result.

This app is using the [Finance Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/) api routed through [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) due Yahoo CORS issue.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
